Welcome to the User Management System GitHub repository! This project provides a robust and intuitive system for managing user information, featuring a React.js frontend, Express.js backend, MongoDB database, and Redux for state management. Whether you're looking to learn about full-stack development or seeking a customizable user management solution, this repository has you covered.

Key Features:

UserList Component (React):

Displays a dynamic list of users fetched from the backend server, offering a real-time view of registered users.
Implements interactive actions, allowing users to edit and delete entries seamlessly.
Utilizes React Hooks for efficient state management and a responsive user interface.
UserForm Component (React, Redux):

Presents an intuitive registration form with validation for various user details.
Incorporates the react-phone-number-input library for a user-friendly mobile number input.
Leverages Redux for centralized state management, dispatching actions such as ADD_USER to handle form submissions.
Sends user data securely to the backend for registration.
Backend Server (Express, MongoDB):

Employs Express.js to power the backend server, defining routes for user registration, deletion, and updates.
Interacts with a MongoDB database to store and retrieve user information, ensuring data integrity.
Implements error handling and response messages for a smooth user experience.
Redux State Management:

Centralizes state management using Redux, facilitating efficient communication between components.
Defines Redux actions (ADD_USER, DELETE_USER) and a reducer (userReducer) to manage state changes.
Database Schema (MongoDB):

Defines a MongoDB schema for user registration, encompassing key user details such as name, email, mobile, and address information.
Implements checks during registration to prevent duplicate user entries and enhance data consistency.
